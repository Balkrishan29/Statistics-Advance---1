        "\n",
        "Answer. Confidence intervals (CIs) are essential in statistical analysis because they provide a range of values within which the true population parameter (such as a mean or proportion) is likely to fall, with a specified level of confidence (usually 95% or 99%).\n",

        "Significance of Confidence Intervals:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Estimate Uncertainty:\n",
        "CIs quantify the uncertainty associated with a sample estimate. Instead of giving just a single point estimate (e.g., sample mean), a CI shows the likely range of values for the true population parameter.\n",

        "By showing the degree of uncertainty, CIs help researchers, policymakers, and analysts make more informed decisions based on data.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Statistical Significance:\n",
        "Confidence intervals can be used to determine whether a result is statistically significant. For example, if a 95% CI for the difference between two group means does not include zero, it suggests a statistically significant difference.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Comparison Tool:\n",
        "CIs allow for comparison between groups or variables. Overlapping confidence intervals might suggest no significant difference, while non-overlapping intervals might indicate a real effect.\n",
